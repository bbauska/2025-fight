# 2025-fight
In 2025, as of Jan 15, we must fight, fight, fight to keep this nation a constitutional democracy. Because it ain't right now.

1) Form an independent , civilian-powered, investigative coalition
  - Experts, veterans, whistleblowers, journalists, watchdog organizations.
  - Deputize the resistance. Build a real-time archive of corruption, overreach,
  and executive abuse.
  - Make it public. Make it unshakable.
  - Let the people drag the rot into the light.
  - If you can't hold formal hearings, hold public ones.
  - If Congress won't act, let the country act.
  - This isn't about optics - It's about receipts.
  - Because at some point, these people will be held accountable.
  - And when that day comes, we'll need every name, every signature, every illegal order,
  every act of silence documented.
  - You're not just preserving truth - you're preparing evidence for prosecution.
  - The more they vanish people, and weaponize data, the more we need truth in the sunlight.

2) Join the International Criminal Court
  - Yes, I said it. Call their bluff.
  - You cannot control what the other side does.
  - But yoiu can control your own integrity.
  - So prove it. Prove that yoiur party is still grounded in law, human rights, DIA, and ethical
  leadership.
  - JOIN.
  - If you've got nothing to hide - join.
  - Show the world who's hiding bodies, bribes, and buried bank accounts.
  - Force the GOP to explsin why they'd rather protect a war criminal than sign a treaty.
  - And while you're at it, publicly invite ICC observers into U.S. borders.
  - Make this administration explain -   on camera - why they're terrified of international oversight.
  
3) Fund state-level resistance infrastructure.
  - Don't send postcards - send resources.
  - Channel DNC funds into rapid-response teams, legal defense coalitions, sanctuary networks, and 
  digital security training.
  - If the federal government is hijacked, build power underneath it.
  - If the laws become tools of oppression, help people resist them legally, locally, and boldly.
  - This is not campaign season - this is an authoritarian purge.
  - Stop campaigning.
  - Act like this is the end of democracy, because IT IS!
  - We will REMEMEBER thie warriors come primaries.
  - Fighting this regime should be your marketing strategy.
  - And let's be clear:
    * The reason the other side always seems three steps ahead is because they ARE.
	* They propared for this.
	* They infiltrated school boards, courts, local legislatures, and police unions.
	* They built a machine (with billions in donations) while you wrote press releases (with thousands).
	* We're reacting - they've been executing a plan for decades (1980's Reagan).
  - Shift from panic to blueprint.
  - You should already be working with strategists and military minds on Project 2029.
  - A coordinated, long-term plan to rebuild this country when smoke clears.
  - You should be publicly laying out:
    * The laws and amendments you'll pass to ensure this never happens again.
	* The systems you'll tear down and the safeguards you'll enshrine.
	* The plan to hold perpetrators of human atrocities acountable.
	* The urgent commitment to immediately bring home those sold into slavery in El Salvador.
	* You say Democrats are the party of the people? Show the people the plan.
	
4) Use your platform to educate the public on rights and resistance tactics.
