<h4>From: Robert Reich</h4>
<h5>Date: Jun 23, 2025</h5>

<p>Friends,</p>

<p>When she was in Congress, I disagreed with almost everything she said and every vote she 
made. But on the transcendent issue of our time — protecting our democracy from Trump 
and the forces of authoritarianism and fascism — Liz Cheney has been correct, clear, and 
courageous. Today I received this text message from her, and I want to share it with you 
because it’s right on point.</p>

<h4>From: Liz Cheney</h4>

<p>Dear Democratic Party,</p>

<p>I need more from you.<br>
You keep sending emails begging for $15, while we’re watching fascism consolidate 
power in real time.</p>

<p>This administration is not simply “a different ideology.”<br>
It is a coordinated, authoritarian machine — with the Supreme Court, the House, the 
Senate, and the executive pen all under its control.</p>

<p>And you?<br>
You’re still asking for decorum and donations. WTF?<br>
That won’t save us.<br>
I don’t want to hear another polite floor speech.</p>

<h4>I want strategy.<br>
I want fire.<br>
I want action so bold it shifts the damn news cycle — not fits inside one.</h4>

<p>Every time I see something from the DNC, it’s asking me for funds.<br>
Surprise.<br>
Those of us who donate don’t want to keep sending money just to watch you stand frozen as 
the Constitution goes up in flames — shaking your heads and saying,<br>
“Well, there’s not much we can do. He has the majority.”</p>

<p>I call bullshit.<br>
If you don’t know how to think outside the box…<br>
If you don’t know how to strategize…<br>
If you don’t know how to fight fire with fire…what the hell are we giving you money for?</p>

<p>Some of us have two or three advanced degrees.<br>
Some of us have military training.<br>
Some of us know what coordinated resistance looks like — and this ain’t it.</p>

<p>Yes, the tours around the country? Nice.<br>
The speeches? Nice.<br>
The clever congressional clapbacks? Nice.<br>
That was great for giving hope.</p>

<p>Now we need action.<br>
You have to stop acting like this is a normal presidency that will just time out in four years.</p>

<p>We’re not even at Day 90, and look at the chaos.<br>
Look at the disappearances.<br>
Look at the erosion of the judiciary, the press, and our rights.<br>
If you do not stop this, we will not make it 1,460 days.</p>

<h3>So here’s what I need from you — right now:</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<ol type="1" start="1">
  <li><h3>Form an independent, civilian-powered investigative coalition.</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>I’m talking experts. Veterans. Whistleblowers. Journalists. Watchdog orgs.</li>
      <li>Deputize the resistance. Build a real-time archive of corruption, overreach, 
	    and executive abuse.</li>
      <li>Make it public. Make it unshakable.</li>
      <li>Let the people drag the rot into the light.</li>
      <li>If you can’t hold formal hearings, hold public ones.</li>
      <li>If Congress won’t act, let the country act.</li>
      <li>This isn’t about optics — it’s about receipts.<br>
      Because at some point, these people will be held accountable.</li>
      <li>And when that day comes, we’ll need every name, every signature, every illegal 
	    order, every act of silence—documented.</li>
      <li>You’re not just preserving truth — you’re preparing evidence for prosecution.</li>
      <li>The more they vanish people and weaponize data, the more we need truth in the sunlight.</li>
	</ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<ol type="1" start = "2">
  <li><h3>Join the International Criminal Court.</h3></li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, I said it. Call their bluff.<br>
You cannot control what the other side does.</p>

<p>But you can control your own integrity.<br>
So prove it. Prove that your party is still grounded in law, human rights, and ethical leadership.<br>
Join.<br>
If you’ve got nothing to hide — join.</p>

<p>Show the world who’s hiding bodies, bribes, and buried bank accounts.<br>
Force the GOP to explain why they’d rather protect a war criminal than sign a treaty.<br>
And while you’re at it, publicly invite ICC observers into U.S. borders.<br>
Make this administration explain — on camera — why they’re terrified of international oversight.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<ol type="1" start = "3">
  <li><h3>Fund state-level resistance infrastructure.</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Don’t just send postcards. Send resources.</li>
      <li>Channel DNC funds into rapid-response teams, legal defense coalitions, sanctuary 
	    networks, and digital security training.</li>
      <li>If the federal government is hijacked, build power underneath it.</li>
      <li>If the laws become tools of oppression, help people resist them legally, locally, and boldly.</li>
      <li>This is not campaign season — this is an authoritarian purge.</li>
      <li>Stop campaigning.<br>
      Act like this is the end of democracy, because it is.</li>
      <li>We WILL REMEMBER the warriors come primaries.</li>
      <li>Fighting this regime should be your marketing strategy.</li>
      <li>And let’s be clear:
	    <ul>
          <li>The reason the other side always seems three steps ahead is because they ARE.</li>
          <li>They prepared for this.
          <li>They infiltrated school boards, courts, local legislatures, and police unions.</li>
          <li>They built a machine while you wrote press releases.</li>
          <li>We’re reacting — they’ve been executing a plan for years.</li>
          <li>It’s time to shift from panic to blueprint.</li>
          <li>You should already be working with strategists and military minds on PROJECT 
	        2029, a coordinated, long-term plan to rebuild this country when the smoke clears.</li>
  	    </ul>
      </li>
      <li>You should be publicly laying out:
        <ul>
	      <li>The laws and amendments you’ll pass to ensure this never happens again</li>
          <li>The systems you’ll tear down and the safeguards you’ll enshrine</li>
          <li>The plan to hold perpetrators of human atrocities accountable</li>
          <li>The urgent commitment to immediately bring home those sold into slavery in El Salvador</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    <li>You say you’re the party of the people?</li>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Then show the people the plan.</p>

      <li>Feed the real stories to BBC, Al Jazeera, The Guardian, Reuters, Der Spiegel —

      <li>Make what’s happening in America a global scandal.</li>
      <li>And stop relying on platforms that are actively suppressing truth.</li>
      <li>Start leveraging Substack. Use Bluesky.</li>
      <li>That’s where the resistance is migrating. That’s where censorship hasn’t caught up.</li>
      <li>If the mainstream won’t carry the truth — outflank them.</li>
      <li>Get creative. Go underground. Go global.</li>

<p>Stop being scared to fight dirty when the other side is fighting to erase the damn Constitution.<br>
They are threatening to disappear AMERICANS.<br>
A M E R I C A N S.</p>

<p>And your biggest move can’t be another strongly worded email.<br>
We don’t want your urgently fundraising subject lines.</p>

<p>We want backbone.<br>
We want action.<br>
We want to know you’ll stand up before we’re all ordered to sit down — permanently.<br>
We are watching.</p>

<p>And I don’t just mean your base.<br>
I mean millions of us who see exactly what’s happening.<br>
I’ve only got 6,000 followers — but the groups I’m in? The networks I touch? Over a quarter million.</p>

<p>Often when I speak, it echoes.<br>
But when we ALL speak, it ROARS with pressure that will cause change.<br>
We need to be deafening.</p>

<p>You still have a chance to do something historic.<br>
To be remembered for courage, not caution.<br>
To go down as the party that didn’t just watch the fall — but fought the hell back with everything they had.</p>

<p>But the clock is ticking.<br>
And the deportation buses are idling.</p>
